Manual → 108H; Semi-auto → 118GH; High-speed → 306/306P; Inline → 719P.\n\n**Q: Why slow drying on corrugated boxes?**\nA: Usually caused by excessive glue, low temp, high humidity, or low-absorbency surfaces. Try 306 or 624 for faster setting.\n\n**Q: Why stringing/splashing on high-speed machines?**\nA: Viscosity-speed mismatch. Use low-stringing adhesives like 306P or 305P. Check roller alignment and glue temperature.\n\n**Q: Can your adhesives be used for food packaging?**\nA: Yes! Certain models comply with food-contact safety standards. Share your regulatory requirements (FDA, EU, etc.) for proper recommendation.\n\n**Q: How should carton glue be stored?**\nA: Store sealed at 5–35°C (41–95°F) in dry, ventilated area.
