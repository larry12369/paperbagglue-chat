Packaging: 50KG/drum, 1000KG/IBC
Shelf Life: 6 months (color may darken over time)

Usage Notes:
1. Surface Treatment:
BOPP film is nonpolar with low surface tension and must be corona treated to achieve proper wetting (>38 dyn/cm). For varnishes and UV coatings, plasma treatment is recommended. Without treatment, bonding failure may occur over time.

2. Winter Instructions:
Maintain workshop temperature above 5–10°C. Warm glue using heating tanks or lamps. Allow glued products to cure in warm conditions for at least 24 hours before dispatch. Increase pressure, glue volume, and ensure proper compression to avoid rebound.

3. Paper Variations:
Over-filled or overly smooth paper may prevent proper penetration. Loose paper may cause glue leakage and result in weak bonding.

4. Material Change:
Due to variations in size, thickness, surface treatment, and glue amount, re-testing is recommended before mass production.

5. Four Key Checks:
Double-sided corona film; plasma treatment; secondary compression; choose the correct adhesive.

6. Bonding Strength Test:
After 3 hours, tear bonded samples to observe fiber tear. After 24 hours, scrape paper from film; good adhesion results in fiber retention. Test high- and low-temperature performance after 24 hours. Perform sampling at days 3 and 7 and before shipment.

Storage & Handling:
Store away from sunlight and rain. Ideal temperature: 15–30°C. Below 5°C adhesive strength decreases; below 2°C glue may fail. Avoid contamination, do not dilute with water, and seal tightly after use. Use dedicated tools for each glue model. Clean tools with water after use.

Operational Instructions:
Stir well after long resting. Ensure adequate glue application (≥0.05g/cm² for thin paper; ≥0.12g/cm² for card). Bond while glue is wet; avoid long open time. Apply pressure (10KG for ≥15 minutes). Cure flat for 24 hours at 15–30°C.
