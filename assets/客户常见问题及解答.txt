1.How do I choose the right adhesive for my folder gluer or carton production line?

Choosing the correct folder gluer adhesive depends on the application method, machine speed, and substrate material.

Manual application → Use manual paper packaging adhesives such as models 106, 108, or 108H

Semi-automatic folder gluers → 118GH or 118G offer stable roller application

High-speed folder gluers → 306, 305P, 1205P, or 9323 are designed for high-speed gluing

Inline production lines → 719 or 727P provide strong wet tack for corrugated board production

Selecting the right corrugated box glue improves bonding strength, reduces waste, and ensures stable machine performance.


2.What factors affect bonding performance in carton and paper bag production?

Several variables influence the performance of carton sealing glue and paper bag adhesive:

Surface condition (dust, ink, coating, lamination)

Paper or board absorbency

Temperature and humidity in the workshop

Glue application amount and uniformity

Pressure and compression time

Proper machine adjustment and correct adhesive selection are essential for achieving strong and consistent bonds in paper packaging production.

3.Why is my adhesive not drying fast enough on corrugated boxes?

Slow drying of corrugated box glue may be caused by:

Excessive glue application

Low room temperature or high humidity

Coated or laminated surfaces with low absorbency

Insufficient airflow around bonded areas

Switching to a faster-setting high-speed gluing adhesive such as model 306 or 624 can significantly improve production efficiency.


4.Why does stringing or splashing occur on high-speed folder gluers?


Stringing or splashing usually indicates a mismatch between adhesive viscosity and machine speed.

For high-speed applications, use low-stringing folder gluer adhesives such as 306P or 305P. Also check:

Roller alignment

Glue supply stability

Adhesive temperature

Proper adhesive rheology is critical in high-speed carton production.


5.Can your adhesives be used for food packaging applications?

Certain paper packaging adhesives can be formulated to comply with food-contact safety standards. Please provide regulatory requirements (FDA, EU, etc.) and packaging structure so a suitable grade can be recommended.

6.How should carton sealing glue be stored?

Store carton sealing adhesive in sealed containers at 5–35°C (41–95°F) in a dry, ventilated area. Avoid freezing and direct sunlight. Stir before use if stored for an extended period.

7.What should I do if the adhesive becomes too thick or too thin?

Viscosity changes in paper bag glue or corrugated box adhesive may result from evaporation or improper storage. Do not dilute without technical guidance. Contact technical support with batch details for adjustment recommendations.

8.Do you provide technical support for folder gluer setup?

Yes. We provide guidance on:

Glue application amount

Roller configuration

Spray system parameters

Troubleshooting bonding issues

Our goal is to ensure stable performance when using our folder gluer adhesives in high-speed packaging production.
