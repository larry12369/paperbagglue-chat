Side hanging coating: Used for carton linking lines
2、侧挂胶：用于纸箱联动线
Top hanging coating: The glue storage part is located above the product, and the glue is transferred to the printed matter through a glue transfer roller, glue application rope, or die.
3、上挂胶：储胶部位于产品的上部，通过转胶轮或涂胶绳或刀模转移到印刷品上
3. Spray Coating
High-pressure spray coating system: The glue output pressure can reach more than 10 bar. The glue is output after amplifying 10 bar inlet pressure, which is the most widely used. For example, HHS, Keqi and other spray coating systems are used for high-speed machines.
1、高压喷胶系统：出胶压力可达 10 个气压以上，10 个进气压放大后出胶，使用最多。比如：HHS、科祺等喷胶系统用于高速机用
Normal-pressure spray coating system: The glue output pressure is below 10 bar, such as pneumatic diaphragm pump systems (taking Fako brand as an example), mostly used for high-speed linking lines. Pressure tank pressure extrusion type: inlet pressure below 10 bar, amplified glue output. The spray coating is not very accurate, usually used for special-shaped custom machines.
2、常压喷胶系统：出胶压力在 10 个气压以下，如气动隔膜泵系统，以阀科品牌为例，多用于高速联动线。压力罐承压挤出式，10 个气压以下进气，放大出胶，喷胶不太精准常用于异形定制机
Used for hot melt adhesive mold temperature machine: ① First melt the solid adhesive block into liquid; ② Then spray the solution at high pressure.
3、用于热熔胶模温机：①把固体胶块先熔化为液体；②再把溶液高压喷出
Supplementary Gluing Devices
Roller coating (roller coating, disc coating): According to the width of the glue application roller: wide roller coating, medium roller coating, fine disc coating.
1. 轮涂 (滚涂，碟涂) 根据涂胶轮宽窄：宽滚涂，中轮涂，细碟涂
Roller coating (coating, die coating): Glue machine, window patching machine for window patching, and bottom gluing of some automatic handbags.
2. 辊涂 (涂布，模具涂)：胶水机，贴窗机贴窗，部分自动手提袋底部涂胶
Screen scraping coating: Some window patching machines must use water-based products with 80-100 mesh screens.
3 印网刮涂：部分贴窗机必需用纯水产品，丝网 80-100 目
Belt transfer coating: Adopted when the glue application tank cannot be designed for some machine models.

a. Mold temperature machine spray coating system: Generally used for hot melt adhesives, and can also be used for spray coating without heating.
a. 模温机喷胶系统，一般用于热熔胶也可不加温直接使用喷胶
b. Spray coating system: Similar in principle to the mold temperature machine but without heating, with high precision and easy adjustment.
b. 喷胶系统和模温机原理类似没有加温，精度高，好调控
c. Pneumatic spray coating: Glue is in a pressure tank and extruded by pressure. The spray head is equipped with an electromagnetic switch for controllable spraying; another type of spray head without a precision control switch has low gluing precision.
c. 气压式喷胶：胶在压力罐内，施压挤出，喷胶头有带电磁开关，可控喷射，另一种是喷胶头，没有精密控制开关，施胶精度较低
d. Air-carried spray coating: Glue is sprayed out by air flow, similar to spray painting. The gluing precision is poor, and the glue needs to be thinner.
d. 气携式喷胶：靠气流把胶带出，如喷漆喷胶面，施胶精度差，这种施胶方式胶要稀一些
Note: Some machine models are also equipped with a glue supplement device (instead of directly pouring into the gluing device, the glue is pumped into the glue tank through a pump). The glue should not be too thick during promotion.
备注：有的机型还有一套胶水补充装置 (不是直接倒入施胶装置，是通过泵把胶抽到胶槽内) 推广时胶水不能太稠。

Chapter 3: Targeted Q&A
1. Customers Discussing Price
a. Are the safety factors of adhesives from different manufacturers the same? Our products have a high safety factor, so the cost cannot be reduced. Saving a little cost is not worth the risk of adhesive failure later. To develop in the long term, we prioritize quality over price. We also have a product with a lower price that works better than what you are using now—we are very confident in it.a 各个厂家做的胶水安全系数一不一样：我们的产品安全系数很高，所以成本上下不来，因为节约成本省的那点钱跟后期的开胶相比得不偿失，要想走的长远我们还是质量第一，然后才是价格，我们还有一款比这个价格低的，也比您现在用的效果要好，我们很有信心；b. We still recommend using high-quality adhesive. When producing products, we should put quality first. The difference in adhesive price per box is negligible, and good quality naturally means a higher safety factor.b 还是建议您用好的胶，咱们做产品还是把质量放在第一位，胶高点低点核算到每个箱子上边，成本微乎其微，好的质量自然安全系数更高；c. Our product formula is different: less glue application but higher output. You can compare by testing.c 我们的产品配方不一样：施胶量小但是出活多，您可以做一下对比，试试就知道了。d. Two customers with a good relationship but different prices: 1. The two customers may not have a good relationship and will not share price information; 2. If they do find out, explain that the adhesive models are different with different solid contents (some are high-quality, some are standard); 3. Let me check and get back to you shortly/I will check the production and delivery records and inform you that we sent you a barrel of high-quality adhesive—you got a better product at a lower price.d 两个客户关系比较好，但是价位不一样：1. 两个客户有可能关系不是很好，串不了价格 2. 如果知道了，告诉客胶的型号不一样，固含量不同，有好的，有坏的，3. 我给您查一下，一会给您回复 / 一会回复，查生产发货记录了，给您发了一桶好的胶水，少花钱，得到好货了
2. What is the difference between high-quality and cheap adhesives?
There is a slight gap in high and low temperature resistance.// For high-quality adhesive, you can feel strong adhesion by hand after brushing. Ultimately, both achieve the same goal—tearing the paper. High-quality machine-use adhesive dries faster.好的跟便宜的有什么区别，耐高温耐低温有点差距，// 好的，你刷完之后用手感觉粘劲很大，能明显感觉出来，最终结果都一样，都是把纸撕破为原则，机用的好的干的越快
3. Are the solid contents the same?
The bonding performance of adhesive is not proportional to solid content; it is related to the formula.含量一样吗：胶的粘接性能跟含量不成正比，跟配方有关系
4. Issue: There is a layer of condensation (peeling, flocculation, foam) on the upper layer of adhesive in a square packaging barrel.
This is normal. There is a layer of air above the adhesive in square barrels, which causes the adhesive to dry. This does not happen in round barrels as there is no air gap.问题，方形的包装桶内，胶水上层有一层凝结物 (起皮，有絮状物，有泡沫状物)：是正常的，方桶上面又一层空气，胶干了，圆桶就不存在，圆通上面没有空气；
5. Issue: There are impurities in the adhesive.
The filter screen was damaged during filtration, and the milky white impurities were invisible. We will pay attention to this next time. If the impurities affect use, you can filter the adhesive with silk stockings or filter cloth.胶里面有杂质：过滤的时候滤网漏了，乳白色的看不见，下次我们注意，如影响使用可用丝袜或滤布过滤一下
Adhesive Usage Instructions
Before use, stir the adhesive evenly. Tightly seal containers with leftover adhesive to prevent surface drying and skinning.
使用前，应注意先将粘合剂搅拌均匀，剩余有粘合剂的容器必须盖紧，以防胶液表面干化结皮。
Ensure sufficient glue application amount: (Adjust the glue thickness according to the paper thickness) The glue application amount can be fully adjusted, mainly depending on the operator's preference.
保证有足够涂胶量：(根据纸张厚度调整涂胶厚度) 上胶量的大小完全可以调，重点是看机长的意思
After gluing, if drying is required, ensure the adhesive remains moist: Press the bonded parts before the adhesive is completely dry. For machine sealing, check the pressing and curing conditions after the product exits the pressing roller of the box gluing machine, depending on the machine speed. If there is any opening, adjust the machine speed or glue application amount, or press the opened products immediately.
涂胶完成后，如需晾置，最迟也要保持胶业还处于湿润状态：未完全干透前压合，机封时根据糊盒机的车速不同，从糊盒机压合辊出来以后，要检查压合及固化情况，如有张口请调整车速或上胶量或将张口产品立即压合
Apply pressure immediately after bonding materials: The pressure and time should be above 10KG/15 minutes. Avoid rebound or uneven pressure after pressing, otherwise the bonding effect will be affected. Sealant will not dry and will remain sticky if not pressed, which is a normal state. If the sealant dries quickly, it will become brittle at low temperatures in winter and easily cause adhesive failure. The qualification standard for sealant is based on paper tearing: after the adhesive penetrates the paper, the tensile force of the adhesive is greater than that of the paper fibers, resulting in paper tearing. During use, higher pressure and longer bonding time lead to better adhesive penetration. Reference standard: 10KG for more than 15 minutes (packaging industry operation standard).
物料粘合后马上施压：施压力度与时间为 10KG/15 分钟以上，放置施压后出现反弹或施压不均匀否则会影响粘贴效果。封口胶在不压实的状态下不会干，会一直黏黏糊糊的，是正常状态。如果做的容易干，到了冬季低温会变得很脆，很容易造成开胶。封口胶的合格标准是以破纸为基点，胶水渗透入纸张后，胶水的拉力大于纸纤维的拉力，展现为破纸状态。使用过程中压力越大、贴合时间越长，胶水对纸张的渗透效果越好，参考标准：10KG 15 分钟以上。(包装行业操作标准)
After pressing, place the bonded products flat to dry at 15℃-40℃ for 24 hours before checking the bonding effect.
施压后，在 15℃-40℃环境中平放干胶 24 小时后看粘贴效果
For sealed products of varnished paper boxes, carefully verify the adhesion between the varnish and the printed matter to prevent separation from the varnish layer after box gluing. If the varnish layer peels off from the printed surface, effective bonding cannot be achieved.
上光纸盒封口产品，须详细验证光油与印品的附着是否牢固，以防糊盒后从光油涂层处断开，如光油层与印刷面脱开，将无法完成有效粘接
Conduct tests under the same conditions before mass production.
批量生产前应做同等条件的测试
Storage temperature: 5℃-50℃
储存温度 5℃-50℃
The view that "the faster the paper is torn after the adhesive is applied by machine, the better" is not entirely correct. 1. If it dries too fast, it will be impossible to rework products that are misaligned. 2. Too fast drying leads to poor long-term stability, high requirements for corona value, and easy box bursting later. This is a common issue with all domestic products. 3. We have products with similar fast-drying performance, but we do not recommend them. 4. The key is to not affect work efficiency and ensure long-term stability!
胶下机器后，把纸撕破越快越好这观点不太正确。1，太快，以后万一有粘歪的产品，不能复工。2，太快了，后期稳定性不好，对电晕值要求高，后期容易炸盒。咱国内所有产品都是这样。3，如果想用类似产品，咱们有这款产品，但不主张推荐 4，不影响工作效率，且后期稳定，这才是关键！
For sealant to prevent box opening later, there are four safeguards: a. Use double-corona film. b. Use adhesive with non-strict requirements for corona value. c. Secondary pressing: closely adhere the bonded parts before the adhesive fully cures. d. Treat the surface with plasma or grinding equipment before gluing. Missing one safeguard is acceptable, but only having one safeguard poses risks in extreme weather.
封口胶，后期不开盒，有四道保险：a 使用双电晕的薄膜。b 使用对电晕值要求不苛刻的胶水。c 二次压实，再胶没有完全使劲之前，密切贴实。d 涂胶水前用等离子或者打磨装置处理。这四道保险，少一道，问题不大，要是只剩一道，在碰到极端天气就存在风险

Chapter 4: After-Sales Handling
1. Physical Changes of Adhesives
Basic Knowledge:
High temperature will thin the adhesive (reduce viscosity).
1. 高温胶水会变稀 (粘度变低)
Low temperature will thicken the adhesive (increase viscosity).
2. 低温胶水会变稠 (粘度变高)
The adhesive will freeze below 0℃ and lose adhesion.
3. 低于 0℃会结冰且胶水不把劲
Long-term exposure to temperatures below 0℃ will cause freezing damage and demulsification, separating glue and water irreversibly, resulting in scrapping.
4. 长时间 0℃以下会冻伤破乳，胶和水分离且不可逆，报废
2. Phenomena During Gluing Process
Issues with spray coating: Nozzle clogging, glue splashing, tail dripping
Solutions:
Adjust spray coating machine parameters
调整喷胶机参数

3. Phenomena of Adhesive Failure After Bonding
Full Adhesive Failure① Does the same adhesive fail when bonding other materials?①相同的胶水粘其他材质的盒子是否开胶② Does the failure occur within 48 hours or after 48 hours of bonding?②粘好后 48 小时内开还是 48 小时后开③ Has the glossy film been treated with plasma?③亮膜是否有等离子处理④ What are the materials of the A-side and B-side of the bonding interface?④粘口的 A、B 面分别是什么材质Note: Communicate with the customer to confirm the above information. Full adhesive failure is basically due to mismatching between materials and adhesive.以上信息需与客户沟通确认，出现全部开的情况基本是材质和胶水匹配的问题
Partial Adhesive Failure① Is the bonding interface of a single box partially open?①单个盒子糊口位置是否是部分开② The opening rate of the same batch.②同一批次的开盒率③ Confirm whether the adhesive is applied to one side or both sides of the bonding interface.③确认胶水是在糊口一边还是两边④ Confirm the storage temperature.④确认仓储的温度⑤ Confirm whether there is continuous tension.⑤确认是否有持续涨力Solutions: 1. After understanding all necessary information, identify the cause of box opening based on the four basic principles and instruct the customer to correct it. 2. Replace with an adhesive model that meets the customer's operation requirements and product needs.解决方式：1. 了解完各种必要信息后，结合四项基本原则指出开盒原因，令其改正 2. 更换符合客户操作要求及满足产品需求的胶水型号
